## Overview
This was my first foray into building web applications from the ground up. 
The entire staff including the CEO's receipts' being uploaded would be corrupted because
the images were being converted to a PDF on the clients side. 
It was impossible to debug because the issue wasn't related to a speci device or photo so it couldn't be replicated. 

## Customer Experience
salespeople on the go needed a way to upload their receipts without errors. 

The prior receipt Website corrupttes images before being sent to Accounting. A simple, reliable, and fast solution was need to capture receipt images, 
so the staff can be reimbursed faster.

People would have to group their expenses together then scan them. 


## Developer Experience
The website was built with Django. 

Receipt images saved to the server without any client side preprocessing to avoid the issues of the prior website. 
The images were further processed  using the images ext data. 

Images processed on the server in a background process, so the end user experience is faster.

## What did I learn
### The value of testing
Testing and code coverage was at the center of this project. The value that was being provided was reliability, so a reliable way to achieve that goal was required.
Throughout the project I learned how to implement and use test driven development. The practice goes back to the root of why the application is being created in the first place.
You start with the end goal first then build the code to fit that goal. All edge cases expected and even the ones found in production become a test case.
At first testing seemed to add a lot of time to the development process, but as the project got bigger it only sped up the development.
I was able to refactor with little worry of breaking changes, it was amazing! I had just came from implementing an entire Accounts Payable workflow where any change could bring down the system.

### Going to production
Along the lines of testing is always having the end goal in mind. This was the first project from the ground up that I ventured into.
I needed to learn how to handle security, user access, integrations into the HR system, web hosting, and how to start a project from stratch.
The process was exhilarating. When I finished I looked for even harder to tackle problems!

### Communication
This is immensely important and cannot be understated at all. I am constantly learning how to be a better communicator.
In this project the key was to give a clear deadline. While this was the first project I had ever built from the ground up.
I made sure I truely understood the problem we were facing, the possible paths forward, and how best to communicate my intentions and deadline to the stakeholders.
With this project almost everyone at the company uses the site from the Sales associate to the C suite executives to the back office administrators - anyone who has expenses!

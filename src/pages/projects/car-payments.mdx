## Overview
When this was first developed it was a simple integration layer of the HR system into our car payments platform.
The value is gave was to automatically remove terminated employees saving money whenever it was missed manually.
Eventually, the service became an integral part and when The CORE Group and Acosta merged it was used as an example of how to properly integrate with a car payment platform.

## Summary
When implementing this task I learned the importance of making sure the functionality works the first time.
There was a few rough patches where the employees were not being added and there was no monitoring in place to catch it.
Once everything was working smoothly, it was a guide for how I developed other integrations.

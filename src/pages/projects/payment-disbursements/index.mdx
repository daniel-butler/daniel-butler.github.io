## Problem space 

The AP department was cutting manual checks

TODO: What was the dollar savings including time?

## customer experience
AP department was always cutting checks in batches. Needed a way to send payments through Nvoicepay. 

Integrates with the accounts payable, DocuPhase, and accounting system. 

Value:

During COViD and the rapid work from home switch was able to completely rely on the system and eliminated all checks cut from the office. 

## Concepts
Payables grouped together into a payment and payments sent as a loose batch. Essentially a payment could be resent but the payables in the payment would not be split. 



## developer experience

Flask app based on test driven development and event driven design. 

Integration with nvoicepay

Grouping of payments into payment batches. 

Api errors from Nvoicepay. Bubbling them up to end users. 

Once and only once can paments be sent because people will not notify you when there is an overpayment however they will not of paid twice.

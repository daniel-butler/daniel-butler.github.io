# Customer Experience
The customer is the business reporting group who needed an accurate way to account for salespeople who are out of the field. 
That way the call metrics can be reported correctly. 

# Developer Experience
This is a component of a larger integration that extended BambooHR, the human capital management system.

## Value Generated
The CIRI operations team saved up to 5 hours each week depending on the number of time off requests for the prior week. Also, the daily CIRI calls are sent to the CEO timely enabling quicker decisions.

## What I learned implementing the project
This was the first time using the Salesforce API. It took some time to learn their system’s paradigm. This was also the first time working in an area I did not have expertise and coordinating with the stake holders before starting the project. It required me to sharpen my communication of assumptions and overall system performance. It was not without its challenges I had missed the requirement of a daily out of office floor amount and had been operating under the assumption that all time off was going to be sent even it is was for only a ½ hour. Instead, they only wanted an out of field event sent over if the employee is out of the office for 4 or more hours in a day.
This was also the first project working with an outside party where Jeremy was not an intermediary. Stretching me to set and meet expectations around the project to people who were not accustomed to the process.

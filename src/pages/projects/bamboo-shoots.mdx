## Overview
When developing the connect platform there was a need to have more information regarding each employee than had been available in the DocuPhase users table. The human capital management system at the time was BambooHR. BambooHR provided a set of APIs at an individual or custom limited view level, but we needed to perform bulk actions based on data not readily available. An example was everyone who reported to a director that had not submitted an expense report need to be included in one reminder email. The hierarchy to get to the director could be five levels deep. 

The solution was to create a program to programmatically call the BambooHR APIs at an individual level then save the data in our database. Essentially creating a caching layer other systems in the connect ecosystem could leverage. 

Todo: expand on event based architecture
Todo: expand on adapters

Todo: list all integrations
- expense reports after acquisition
- Out of Field
- Hierarchy maps for expense reporting
- COViD screener (out that day, who to escalate to, who to remind, validate the employee number)
- Receipt Capture employee list

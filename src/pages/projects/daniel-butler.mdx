This website is a static website which uses nextjs to export the artifacts onto the gh-pages branch. 
It uses github actions to auto publish changes.
You can look at the source code [here](https://github.com/daniel-butler/daniel-butler.github.io)!

This is the second iteration. 
What I learned is in order for the site to stay active it needs to be extremely low maintenance.

The process starts when the realtor has a new listing. Part of listing a house is to get the word out by putting up a for sale sign. Realtors can buy all the posts and signs and put them up themselves or use a local contracting company to do the work for them. Many realtors decide to go with the latter because they don't need to spend money up to buy the posts, find a place to store them, or even haul them around.

When a realtor wants to get a post to a listing they enter a place post order through the site. The order specifies the realtors information making the order, what rental assets they want, where the assets should be setup (including how the Realty sign will be hung up), the listing address, and what, if any, special instructions are needed to get to the listing. The realtor then informs the owners a for sale post will be placed in the yard and to mark where not to put the post, and possibly where to put it.

Depending on the local rules and regulations, the post may have to be approved by a third party before it can be placed. The third party is generally a utility company Miss Utility or 811 dig are examples. The approval process takes between 3-5 business days, according to competitor sites.

Once the order is placed the installer determines the priority and the various stops required to complete the order. The stops can include picking up the assets from a storage site and/or the realtor's location.

Once at the listing address the installer determines where the post and other materials, if any, are to be setup. They take pictures of the work tasks_completed and send it to the realtor for confirmation. They then leave the listing for the next stop.

After completing the orders, the installer invoices their clients for the work tasks_completed on a daily, weekly, or monthly cadence depending on the relationship with the client.

After the assets are installed the realtor could call to ask to remove, change or add assets at a listing which already has assets from the install. In that circumstance, the realtor will be invoiced as if the order was for a new listing.

Unfortunate and unexpected events can and do happen after the post and other assets are setup. The posts could be stolen or damaged at the property. Both of which require a new post to be placed at the listing. The post and assets setup by the installer could also be done incorrectly. Depending on the cause of the problem, the realtor or the installer will be liable for the trip to the listing, up to a predetermined about for the realtor.

When the listing is removed, either because the home was sold or the listing agent wass removed an order to remove the post is sent to the installer. These requests are prioritized in the installers planned work described earlier. Once the installer includes the listing in their plan for the day, they go to the listing to remove the post and keep, return, or leave any of the realtor's assets, depending on the realtor's request. The materials the realtor requests the installer to keep are stored at the installer's storage location depending on when it fits into their schedule.

If after a predetermined time, normally 3-6 months, and the assets are still at a listing the realtor is changed a fee for continuing to rent the assets. The fee can vary depending on the service area, assets at the listing, and relationship with the realtor.

There are circumstances where the post and other rental assets could be removed from one listing and placed at another by the realtor. In those circumstances the realtor is invoiced as if the installer did the work themselves. The prior listing will be removed and a new order is placed which requires no work, planning, or approval(?). (What do we do if no approval is obtained - only make the approval a task?)

Placement or removal orders can be canceled up the point they are tasks_completed (the installer left the property). Depending on the circumstances and relationship with the realtor will be invoiced for the time and/or costs including time to receive a third party approval.

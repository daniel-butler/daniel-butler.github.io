## Introduction
This is the collection of completed examples while working  though the excellently written [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) on a journey to learn Rust.

My experience with programming while going through this book is mostly python, a few years of JavaScript, a little less of typescript, and about a year and a half of Java. This is my second attempt to go through the book. At the time, types and differences in computers memory didn't really click. This time around the decisions made with the language are making a lot more sense. 

Since I don't have any real world problems to solve with rust, I'm completing every example and will be posting it here. Also, to help give feedback and to test chat gpt I'm using it to review the code.

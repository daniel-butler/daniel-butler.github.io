> you try it

yes. really. that's the whole prompt that can changed your entire relationship with llms/ai. 
it's absolutely magical the first time you see it. 

the biggest thing is you have to do this from a local agent environment like Claude Code, Cowork, codex, etc. 

try it and let me know what you think.

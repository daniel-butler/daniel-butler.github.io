## Overview
The example comes from the prompt below in the [rust book's chapter 17 section 3](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-03-oo-design-patterns.html). 

> To see the simplicity of maintaining code that uses the state pattern, try a few of these suggestions:
>
> -   Add a `reject` method that changes the post’s state from `PendingReview` back to `Draft`.
> -   Require two calls to `approve` before the state can be changed to `Published`.
> -   Allow users to add text content only when a post is in the `Draft` state. Hint: have the state object responsible for what might change about the content but not responsible for modifying the `Post`.



### Result
Below is the code I wrote to solve the three challenges above. I struggled with getting the value for the `Optional<Box<...>>`. I'm starting to grasp that it all goes back to the types when working with rust. Types are not as big of a deal in Python, so that is taking some getting used to. 

```rust
use blog::Post;

fn main() {
    let mut post = Post::new();

    post.add_text("I ate a salad for lunch today");
    assert_eq!("", post.content());

    post.request_review();
    assert_eq!("", post.content());
	
	post.reject();
	assert_eq!("", post.content());
	
	post.request_review();
    assert_eq!("", post.content());
	
	post.approve();
	post.approve();
	assert_eq!("I ate a salad for lunch today", post.content());
}


mod blog {
	pub struct Post {
		state: Option<Box<dyn State>>,
		content: String,
	}
	
	impl Post {
		pub fn new() -> Post {
			Post {
				state: Some(Box::new(Draft {})),
				content: String::new(),
			}
		}
		
		pub fn add_text(&mut self, text: &str) {
			if let Some(s) = self.state.as_ref() {
				println!("Can add content: {}", s.can_add_content());
			
				if s.can_add_content() {
					self.content.push_str(text);
				}
			}
		}
		
		pub fn content(&self) -> &str {
			let content = self.state.as_ref().unwrap().content(self);
			println!("content: {}", content);
			content
		}
		
		pub fn request_review(&mut self) {
			if let Some(s) = self.state.take() {
				self.state = Some(s.request_review())
			}
		}
		
		pub fn approve(&mut self) {
			if let Some(s) = self.state.take() {
				self.state = Some(s.approve());
			}
		}
		
		pub fn reject(&mut self) {
			if let Some(s) = self.state.take() {
				self.state = Some(s.reject());
			}
		}
	}
	
	trait State {
		fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State>;
		fn approve(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State>;
		fn reject(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State>;
		fn content<'a>(&self, _post: &'a Post) -> &'a str {
		 	""
		 }
		fn can_add_content(&self) -> bool {
			false
		}
	}

	struct Draft {}
	
	impl State for Draft {
		fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
			Box::new(PendingReview::new())
		}
		
		fn approve(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
		 	self
		}
		 
		fn reject(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
		 	self
		}
		 
		fn can_add_content(&self) -> bool {
			true
		}
	}
	
	struct PendingReview {
		reviews: i8
	}
	impl PendingReview {
		pub fn new() -> PendingReview {
			PendingReview { reviews: 0 }
		}
		
		pub fn add_review(&mut self) {
			self.reviews += 1;
		}
		
		pub fn get_reviews(&self) -> i8 {
			self.reviews
		}
	}
	impl State for PendingReview {
		fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
			self
		}
		
		fn approve(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
			let mut state = PendingReview::new();
			state.add_review();
		
			if self.as_ref().get_reviews() == 0 {
				Box::new(state)
			} else {
				Box::new(Published {})
			}
		}
		
		fn reject(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
		 	Box::new(Draft {})
		 }
	}
	
	struct Published {}
	
	impl State for Published {
		fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
			self
		}
		
		fn approve(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
		 	self
		 }
		 
		fn reject(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
		 	self
		 }
		 
		fn content<'a>(&self, post: &'a Post) -> &'a str {
			&post.content
		}
	}
}
```


## Refinement
Now, what can be learned from asking ChatGPT?

Open AI's ChatGPT prompt. 

```
Refactor this code to be more performant.
```

### Response

One possible way to make the code more performant is to avoid unnecessary allocations and cloning of data. One such example is in the `content()` method of the `State` trait, where the content is cloned unnecessarily.

1. Instead, we can use a reference to the existing content to avoid the clone:

```rust
fn content<'a>(&self, post: &'a Post) -> &'a str {
    &post.content
}
```

2. Similarly, in the `add_text()` method of the `Post` struct, we can use a reference to the text to avoid the allocation and copying of the string:

```rust
pub fn add_text(&mut self, text: &str) {
    if let Some(s) = self.state.as_ref() {
        if s.can_add_content() {
            self.content.push_str(text);
        }
    }
}
```

3. We can also avoid unnecessary boxing and dynamic dispatch by using an enum instead of a trait object for the state of the post. This can simplify the code and make it more efficient:

```rust
mod blog {
    pub struct Post {
        state: State,
        content: String,
    }

    #[derive(Debug)]
    enum State {
        Draft { can_add_content: bool },
        PendingReview { reviews: i8 },
        Published,
    }

    impl Post {
        pub fn new() -> Post {
            Post {
                state: State::Draft { can_add_content: true },
                content: String::new(),
            }
        }

        pub fn add_text(&mut self, text: &str) {
            if let State::Draft { can_add_content: true } = self.state {
                self.content.push_str(text);
            }
        }

        pub fn content(&self) -> &str {
            if let State::Published = self.state {
                &self.content
            } else {
                ""
            }
        }

        pub fn request_review(&mut self) {
            if let State::Draft { .. } = self.state {
                self.state = State::PendingReview { reviews: 0 };
            }
        }

        pub fn approve(&mut self) {
            if let State::PendingReview { reviews } = &mut self.state {
                *reviews += 1;
                if *reviews >= 2 {
                    self.state = State::Published;
                }
            }
        }

        pub fn reject(&mut self) {
            if let State::PendingReview { .. } = self.state {
                self.state = State::Draft { can_add_content: true };
            }
        }
    }
}
```

With these changes, the code should be more efficient and performant.

## Summary
For the first two points, as best I can tell, it is already happening. And the last point is fair and even called out in the rusty book. We used `Box`s to show how they work with `dyn trait`s. Overall because I didn't come up with a majority of the code it didn't leave a lot of room for ChatGPT to fix it.

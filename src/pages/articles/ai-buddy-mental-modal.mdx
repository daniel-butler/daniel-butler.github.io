> my mental model for AI coding assistants is an _incredibly_ well-read junior engineer with questionable taste, unlimited enthusiasm, no ego, ADHD, and a traumatic brain injury that causes pretty serious memory issues. If they write something down, they're good. They've developed all sorts of wild coping strategies that are far more effective than they have any right to be. They generally have no spine and back down way too fast when you question something they're doing...even if they're right. They're prone to distraction. Again, getting them to write down what they're supposed to be doing can help a ton.

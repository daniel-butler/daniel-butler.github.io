This developer created a game-changing tool that allows the Accounts Payable team to enter hundreds of lines for 70+ invoices or credit memos at a time, saving hours of manual entry. With the ability to generate required expensing journal entries and easily track payables in the accounting system, this tool improves workflow consistency and accuracy during critical times like Month End, Audit, and Tax preparation. Plus, with Vuetify's Material Design and a separate background process for long running tasks, this tool offers a rich responsive user experience.

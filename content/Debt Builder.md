#BPM - The Debt Builder 

Putting the most visible and relied upon  processes  of a business in an automated system is a good idea. Ones without built in assurance the worst. Because BPM solutions are built to become your most visible pile of technical debt. 

### Starting down the path
If you are like me and have worked in or would like to implement BPM workflow software you get why it’s important. 
It enables you to make a visual map of the process, changes are clearly visible and can be done on the fly. You don’t need to be a software developer to make a big impact. 

What processes have you or are you thinking about automating? The low hanging fruit, right? It’s probably some type of accounting or administrative work. The kind of work that doesn’t change often, you have a standard method whether or not it’s written down. At first blush it id easy to imagine the working pieces. When thinking about the problem there are probably a few hard and fast rules that you know you have to comply with.  Like new vendor payments require approval, the packing slip has to match the invoice or new employees have to have a signed contract, you get the idea. No matter what happens you want to make sure THOSE are happening. 

Fast forwarding to a happy place where you have an automated process in place, people have accepted and trusted the system, even through the bumps. 
While working on there are ideas on how to improve the process or great feedback from users that would make their lives easier. If this is your first time automating a process it's all steams ahead. If this is your second time around you are already nervous. 

You start making the requested changes people are enjoying the process your simple and easy to understand process is adapting to the real world. 
It’s starting to handle the one off situations. 
Not to break the system or for times sake shortcuts are taken here and there and slowly you have an extremely robust process that is almost what you are looking for… 
Everything works great if you are lucky for a year or two. 
But if your organization is competitive, processes are always adapting to the changing world. 

### Make it real
Taking a real world example I’m living in. 
We implemented an expense report process that takes expense reports created by our sales staff, routes them to their Approver, highlights out of policy spend, once approved is forwarded to accounting and then is sent off to be paid. 
Simple. 
We added the ability for accounting to send the reports back to approvers, the original person or both, ability to mark lines as reviewed by Accounting that isn’t visible to people outside the department, history of prior reports and quick summaries of what matters is shown and more. 
What has happened is, key players have retired or left the company leaving a massive challenge of forwarding in process reports and dynamically assigning approvers correctly. 
In truth, is a problem that is easily seen in hindsight. 
When walking a tightrope the next step is the most important not what you can do once on the other side. 
This is only one example but shows that over time things change, management direction changes, people retire or change jobs. 
Through everything business has to continue though. 

Now we need to fundamentally change the process. 
The tribal knowledge that was built during the creation of the process workflow is lost.
It’s been a year or two since you’ve worked in it! The workflow is now complex (it’s adapted to the real world after all!) so it’s easy to break and hard to catch errors before people notice. 
That is the definition of Technical Debt. 
We didn’t build this debt when first creating the process it was added and multiplied by each iteration to make the process fit the real world. 

Ok cool, so we make some changes and it breaks stuff what does it matter? 
Do you remember the things that HAD to be done no matter what? 
If you’re lucky they didn’t change on you and that’s why you are making these fundamental changes. 
Those things that had to be correct weren’t the nice extras or the exceptions that you added. 
They are the reason for the process. They also probably came from the people who hold power in the organization. 
Missing on those is a big deal. 
Obviously you don’t want to do that but how can you prevent it from happening? 
The only solution now is to have a test example that you run every time you make a change. 
That generally works, it’s not always possible if you don’t have a separate test system, but it takes a long time so if you’re like most people you stop doing it. 
Or do it every once in a while. 

### Testing and Assurance should be first class citizens
There are a lot of changes but testing only happens every once in a while. 
If ever. 
That means you won’t know what changes broke the most important part of your process. 
When that happens, it's harder to fix. 
The longer it takes to fix, the trust you’ve built over the past year or so will evaporate faster than you can imagine. 
This is why I think the current state of BPM software sets you up to fail. After that experience you’ll shy away from working on BPM software. 
Let alone wanting to maintain the extremely complex thing you’ve built.
